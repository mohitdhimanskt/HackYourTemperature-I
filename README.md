 PROJECT: HackYourTemperature I

    In this part of the homework you'll be setting up the basis of your project: HackYourTemperature. Inside the folder homework, create a new folder called hackyourtemperature. You'll add to it every week.

In this module you'll be rebuilding an existing application, starting from scratch. The application is called HackYourTemperature and you can find it here: HackYourTemperature.

Each week you'll be building a certain part of it. This week we'll get started with creating a web server, using Express.js.

    Create a JavaScript file called server.js (it can be any name but this is more meaningful)
    Initialize the Node Package Manager and create a package.json file by running npm init -y
    Install and load in the necessary modules for this project: they are express (our web server), express-handlebars (our templating engine) and axios
    Set up your web server using Express (creating an Express instance, listen to port 3000)
    Make a GET request to / that sends the message hello from backend to frontend! to the client

After writing all this code you can verify that it's working by running node server.js from the Command Line and checking your browser at http://localhost:3000. The page should display the message hello from backend to frontend!.
